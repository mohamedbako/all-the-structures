# Python
This is the directory containing python implementations of the different structures/algorithms, written using Python 2.7. PyUnit is used for unit testing.

To run the tests run the following:
```bash
python test.py
```

If you would like to run performance tests on the different sorts, run the following:
```bash
# number passed in is the size of the array to test sorts on
python -m structures.timing_test 10000
```
