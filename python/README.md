# Python
This is the directory containing python implementations of the different structures/algorithms, written using Python 2.7. PyUnit is used for unit testing.

To run the tests run the following if you have bash:

```bash
bash test.sh
```

Otherwise run:

```
python test.py
```

However, note that just running the python script won't clean up the generated python bytecode that's compiled when the tests are run.
