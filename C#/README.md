# C\# Implementations
This folder holds the C# implementations of the various data structures and algorithms that are in this repo. To run the code in this repository, you'll need to have Visual Studio (I believe it should work with 2012+) and .NET 4.6.1. There's no driver for this portion of the repo, with testing instead being done via unit tests which can be run through the test explorer in Visual Studio (Test > Run > Run All Tests).
